# Vulk
Vulkan, but shortened.

## What is this?

LibVulk is a _**work in progress**_ library meant to simplify the Vulkan workflow for developers. Just as the great [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) simplifies OpenGL.

The core purpose of this project was to learn how to use the Vulkan Graphics API. But might as well make something useful for others!  
Also, we are liking the API so far so our hope is to make it grow as far as possible. ðŸ˜„

## Work In Progress

As said above, the lib is very *very* work in progress. It is not ready to be used. But if you are interested, thank you for that and hopefully we can release the 1.0 soon enough! ðŸ˜„
